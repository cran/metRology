\details{
A plot of standard deviations against locations is produced, together 
with optional confidence region(s) calculated (by default) by a 
method suggested in ISO 13528:2005.

If \code{s} is supplied, \code{x} is taken as a vector of locations and 
\code{s} a vector of standard deviations. \code{degfree} must be supplied
in this case.

If \code{g} is supplied and \code{s} is not, the locations and standard deviations
used are the means and standard deviations for each group. \code{degfree} is calculated 
from the median group size. Groups should, of course, be of the same size for accurate 
inference; however, using the median group size allows for some groups with missing values. 

If \code{s} and \code{g} are both supplied, \code{g} is ignored with a warning

If requested by \code{contours=TRUE}, confidence regions are drawn for each value
of \code{probs}. Contour location and shape are controlled by \code{basis}
which specifies the location and scale estimators used, and \code{method}, which 
specifies the method of calculation for the contours. Two methods are supported; 
one using the chi-squared distribution (\code{method="chisq"}) and one based on 
equal density countours (\code{method="density"}). The default, and the method 
recommended by the cited Standard, is \code{method="chisq"} and \code{basis="robust"}.

Both calculations for confidence regions require estimation of a location \eqn{\hat{\mu}}{X} 
and an estimate \eqn{\hat{\sigma}}{S} of the pooled within-group standard deviation or pooled 
estimate from \code{s}. If \code{basis="robust"}, \eqn{\hat{\mu}}{X} and \eqn{\hat{\sigma}}{S}
are calculated using \code{algA} and \code{algS} respectively. If \code{basis="classical"}, 
\eqn{\hat{\mu}}{X} and \eqn{\hat{\sigma}}{S} are the mean of the group means and the classical pooled 
standard deviation respectively. If \code{mu} or \code{sigma} are given, these are used
in place of the calculated  \eqn{\hat{\mu}}{X} and \eqn{\hat{\sigma}}{S} respectively.

If \code{method="chisq"}, contours for probability \eqn{p} are calculated as 

\deqn{s=\hat{\sigma}\exp\left ( \pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{2(n-1)}}\sqrt{\chi_{2,p}^2-n \left ( \frac{x-\hat{\mu}}{\hat{\sigma}}\right ) ^2}\right )}{s=S * exp( +-( 1/sqrt(2(n-1)) ) * sqrt(pchisq(p,2) - n * ( (x-X)/S ) ^2))}

for \eqn{x}{x} from %
\eqn{ \hat{\mu}-\hat{\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{\chi_{2,p}^2}{n}}}{X - S * sqrt(pchisq(p,2)/n)} to 
\eqn{\hat{\mu}+\hat{\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{\chi_{2,p}^2}{n}}}{X + S * sqrt(pchisq(p,2)/n)}.  


If \code{method="density"}, contours for probability \eqn{p} are calculated using 
Helmert's distribution to provide constant likelihood contours round the chosen mean 
and standard deviation. In the present implementation, these are found using
\code{uniroot} to find the mean corresponding to the required density at
given standard deviations. The density chosen is \eqn{d_{max}(1-p)} where \eqn{p} is
the probability and \eqn{d_{max}} the maximum density for Helmert's 
distribution for the requisite nunber of degrees of freedom. (See Kruskal 
(1946) for a description of Helmert's distribution and, for example, 
Pawitan (2001) for the rationale behind the choice of density
contour level.) This seems to give reasonably good results for \eqn{n \ge 3 }
but is anticonservative (particularly to high \eqn{s}) for \eqn{n = 2 }. 
 
Contours are by default labelled. Label locations can be specified using \code{pos.clab}. 
Options are code{"top"}, code{"topright"}, code{"right"}, code{"bottomright"}, 
code{"bottom"}, code{"bottomleft"}, code{"left"} and code{"topleft"}. A vector can be 
specified to give labels at more than one such location. 
Contour labels are usually placed approximately at the location(s) indicated and adjusted outward 
appropriately. For the special case of \code{method="density"} and  \code{degfree=1} (or where group 
sizes \eqn{n=1}{n=1}), for which the region is a maximu width at s=0, 
\code{"bottomright"} and \code{"bottomleft"} place labels immediately below the countour boundary 
at \eqn{s=0}{s=0} and, if specified, \code{"bottom"} is replaced with \code{c("bottomright", "bottomleft")}.

  		
\code{XSplot} is an alias for \code{xs.plot}.
